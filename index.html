      <u><h2>What is forensic?</h2></u>
      Forensic science is a critical element of the criminal justice system. Forensic scientists examine and analyze evidence from crime scenes and elsewhere to develop objective findings that can assist in the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of crime or absolve an innocent person from suspicion.
<br>
<u><h2>What do scientists do?</h2></u>
Work as a forensic scientist can involve: collecting trace evidence from scenes of crime or accidents and recording findings. analysing samples such as hair, body fluids, glass, paint and drugs in the laboratory. applying various techniques as appropriate; eg DNA profiling, mass spectrometry, chromatography.

     <u> <h2>History Development</h2></u>
      Although it is uncertain exactly where the concept of forensic science originated, most historical experts agree it was very likely in China around the 6th century or earlier. This belief is based on the earliest known mention of the concept, found in a book titled ‚ÄúMing Yuen Shih Lu,‚Äù printed in that period.

             <u><h2>Different Ways</h2></u>
             DNA analysis, Finger printing, voice recognition, hand writing analysis, ballistics, autopsy etc are forensic methods to detect a reason for crime or death. Most important areas of physical, life and materials science are used in forensic analytical techniques.20 Oct 2022

<u><h2>Finger Prints</h2></u>
Five methods are described for the detection of latent fingerprints on human skin: the X-ray method, the application of laser radiation, the iodine-silver plate transfer method, development with iron powder and Dakty-foil, as well as the photographic paper lift technique.

<h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;font-size:52px;">CASE STUDY</h1>
<article id="case study"></h2></u>
Authorities in Tallahassee were about three weeks into their investigation of the January 1978 attacks on five Florida State University students, leaving two sorority sisters dead and three other women hospitalized with serious injuries, when word came that a child had disappeared in a town about 90 miles east.

Kimberly Leach, a seventh-grader in Lake City, Florida, had gone missing in the middle of the school day on Feb. 9, 1978.

"It was raining, drizzly, (a) very dreary day," said childhood friend and classmate Lisa Little. "I went to our designated spot to meet up to go to our class together and she wasn't there."

Lake City police searched for Kimberly but found nothing. Authorities urged the public to come forward with any information.

"We knew something was wrong. She, Kim, was not a student to skip class, to leave campus," classmate Sheri Roberts McKinley said. "I mean, we were 12. And, she was very shy."

Before Kimberly was found, police in Pensacola apprehended Ted Bundy, a convicted kidnapper, suspected killer and fugitive on the FBI's Most Wanted list.

He'd escaped Colorado authorities twice in 1977 -- once by jumping from a courthouse window and later escaping from a jail cell.

About two months after Kimberly went missing, in April 1978, her body was found. She had been assaulted and murdered and then placed in a little shed in a wooded area behind Suwannee River State Park."We knew something was wrong. She, Kim, was not a student to skip class, to leave campus," classmate Sheri Roberts McKinley said. "I mean, we were 12. And, she was very shy."

 <u><h2>FUN FACTS</h2></u>
Teeth are typically the most reliable identifiers when it comes to identifying a corpse. Teeth are bones, and bones last a long time so that‚Äôs why teeth are typically used to identify bodies ‚Äî they are correct around 93% of the time.
Did you know that hair roots can help identify gender? Hair found at a crime scene can be very helpful in terms of evidence, but only the hair root contains a person‚Äôs DNA and that can help determine a person‚Äôs gender.
Testing takes a lot longer than what‚Äôs portrayed in your favorite TV show. Truth be told, it can take up to two or three weeks for DNA test results to come back from the lab for forensics results.
Bugs can help solve a crime. It‚Äôs actually called forensic entomology. While bugs can‚Äôt actually solve a crime, investigators are able to look inside of an insect‚Äôs (typically a maggot) stomach and is able to determine how long a body has been decomposing.
This one is random, but glitter is PERFECT when it comes to evidence. For one, it‚Äôs easily transferable from one person to another. Two, since it‚Äôs something not so obvious (unlike blood), suspects probably won‚Äôt wash it off immediately, if it even comes off their bodies at all. And lastly, it‚Äôs easy to fine with the shine of a flashlight. The likelihood that a crime scene involves glitter is not very likely, but‚Ä¶ the more you know. üôÇ
